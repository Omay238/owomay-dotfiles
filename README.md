# owomay-dotfiles
###### a set of dotfiles fated to mediocrity but hey it's alright i'm a winner

made for hack club riceathon

## installation
i'm not really sure how one is supposed to distribute dotfiles, so i'm just
making a bash script that installs them. feel free to not use it and
look to see what all they do, but they're designed to help you set up from
scratch.

so, after getting the disk formatted and mounted as in the arch installation
guide (everything in stage 1), you can run `install.sh`.  
this sets up just about everything for you, and then you can unmount and
reboot. it requires user input, but should make it easy.
